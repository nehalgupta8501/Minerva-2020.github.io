            <h5 class="by-line">By Divya Chakarwarti, 8th Jan 2021</h5><br />
            <img src="goldman.jpg" class="fakeimg" align-content="center" style="height: 400px;"></img><br /><br />
            <div class="content">
              <p><strong><em>
                    “It is our choices that show what we truly are far more than our abilities.”
                  </em></strong></p>
              <br />
              <p>
                No words could have left a deeper impression on me, than these from Professor Dumbeldore.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                On 1st August 2017, I kicked off my journey at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women. It all started by uncovering what life had to serve. I tried exploring a subset of the infinite opportunities college life had to
                offer. The first year flew up in making an ambitious school girl into a confident young college girl.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                I didn't really start to code before my 2nd year. Having no prior experience in coding, I started learning basic coding in Java. The semester quickly went away in paving my way through the push() and pop() operations of the stack and
                coping up the semester exams. By December of 2018, I managed to keep my head above waters and developed a genuine interest in collecting more stars on hackerrank. I was aware that to crack the internship season ahead, I had to have
                good projects in addition to good coding skills. So, I applied for research internships at various IITs, which I personally feel was the best way to explore my interest in Master’s and to get a good project on my resume. Luckily, I
                got one at IIT Delhi. Around the same time, I discovered a new platform called Codeforces. And very soon my 8 pm to 10 pm got reserved in those short contests. Nothing can be compared to the adrenaline rush those contests gave me!
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                During the summers of 2018, I was exposed to long pieces of code (around 11,000 LOC) as a part of my internship at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. It was about writing a patch code for Qemu software that can generate
                traces. The evenings of weekdays and weekends either went in those codeforces contests or solving questions on GeeksforGeeks. Just 15 days before the start of the internship season at college, my IIT internship ended. I knew that this
                was the time I needed to gear up my practice. To paint a mental picture of what the corporate interviews are like, I appeared for multiple mock interviews.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Google was the first company to come on campus for recruiting. The shortlisting was based on the resume alone. Unfortunately, my resume was not shortlisted. Unaware of what was going to follow, I got upset. Following evening, I had a
                walk with my mom and that consoled me a bit. I reframed my resume, verified it from my seniors, and got my hopes together. Next came on campus was Goldman Sachs. I appeared for the internship test on the 28th of July. Somehow, got
                through it and appeared for the interview the next day. Waiting for about 6 hours, I appeared for the two interview rounds. Results were out at 7 in the evening. Selected! I made it through.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p><strong><em>
                    “What the mind can conceive and believe, and the heart desire, you can achieve.”
                  </em></strong></p>
              <br />
              <p>
                I still couldn’t get over that adrenaline rush of Codeforces contests. Around the same time, the Olympics of programming contest - ICPC was about to take place. I, along with two of my close friends, thought of giving it a chance. And
                by god’s grace, luck, and coding practice, we made it to the regionals. We represented our college at the Amritapuri onsite regionals of 2019 with a special mention of being the only all-girls team out of the whole lot. Fast forward
                to 2020, during the adverse time of COVID, all things went online. My internship at Goldman Sachs turned out to be a work from the home affair. Missing out on the wonderful experience of actual corporate life became a major regret.
                But all this swept away on receiving a pre-placement offer at the firm.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Finally, getting closer to the end of this beautiful four-year journey makes me experience a whirlwind of emotions. I really want to exhibit sincere gratitude to my parents, teachers, friends, and seniors, who have been a support
                system for the entire journey up till now and thereon. It would have been impossible without them. I would also like to mention my juniors who bestowed me with their love and affection. I would end up saying -
              </p>
              <br />
              <p><strong><em>
                    “Always believe in your dreams. Give your best. And forces will take care of the rest.”
                  </em></strong></p>
